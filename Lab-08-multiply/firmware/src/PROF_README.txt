For the profs teaching CISC-211 in Spring '24 semester:
The src subdirectory for this project contains a second version of the "main.c" file, called "main_spring_24.c".
For Spring '24 and later editions of CISC-211, delete "main.c". Then rename "main_spring_24.c" to "main.c".
Then delete this README file. 
The new file has better test cases and improved error detection.
